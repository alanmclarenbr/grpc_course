# grpc_course
Source code from following this course: https://pega.udemy.com/course/grpc-java/learn/lecture/10324754#overview

JUnit tests added as an extra. Of course not fully covered since I'm focusing only on the integration tests, so for now there won't be units + mocks, since my priority is learning and seeing gRPC working
